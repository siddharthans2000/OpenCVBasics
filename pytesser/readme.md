**IPL commenting using OPENCV**

I made this project using the pytesseract for the character
recognition. This is actually a basic project demonstrating the score and overs and players who are on strike.
Made this using OpenCV. 
Just took th position of the score board using matplotlib
Used Pycharm IDE
